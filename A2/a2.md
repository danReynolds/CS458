b)

The bank uses three authentication factors to identify Alice. The first is something she knows,
which is her PIN. Rather than allowing her to change it over the phone, the bank also uses something
she has, her bank card, by telling her she must change it at one of the bank's ATMs. Finally, the bank
uses something related to context, her location, specifying that Alice must authenticate at one of their
banks.

Alice initially identifies the bank by calling her bank's phone number. Alice then identifies the bank
by going to one of the bank's machines to change her PIN.

The bank identifies Alice by her card number when she is instructed to go put her card into one of their ATMs
to perform the change.

iii) read D103:

D103: (TS, {B, E}), Alice: (S, {B})

iv) write D104:

D104: (S, {B}), Alice: (S, {B})
